## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14.x or later recommended)
-   npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
-   MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
-   Git

## 1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content (replace placeholder values):
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/househuntDB  # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string
JWT_SECRET=yourSuperStrongAndSecretJWTKeyPleaseChangeThis

## 2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
cd ../frontend  # If you are in the backend directory
# or cd frontend (if you are in the root house-hunt-mern directory)
npm install

The frontend uses a proxy to communicate with the backend during development. This is already configured in frontend/package.json:
"proxy": "http://localhost:5001"

## 3. Running the Application
You'll need two separate terminal windows:
Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server
cd backend
npm run server

The backend server should start on http://localhost:5001 (or the port specified in your .env).
Terminal 2: Start the Frontend React App
cd frontend
npm start

The React development server will start, and your application should open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.


## Seeding Initial Data
To populate the database with initial sample users and listings:
Ensure your MongoDB server is running.
Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal.
Run the seeder script:
npm run seed

This will clear existing users and listings and then insert new sample data. Passwords for sample users will be automatically hashed.

To destroy (delete) all data from the users and listings collections:
npm run seed:destroy
